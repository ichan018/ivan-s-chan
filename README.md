## üèó What's next?
Customize this template to make it your own. Remember to make your layout responsive - if you want your site to look good on smaller screens like mobile. 

## üé® Where to find everything

- **External style sheet:** The template you chose is built with [W3CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp), placed in an external style sheet. You can either replace that style sheet - or keep it simple and leave it in.  
	[Go to tutorial about W3CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp)

- **Fonts:** Explore the options from **Google fonts** and add your favorite.

- **Icons:** Icons are from **Fontawesome**. You can reuse those and choose other free icons from their free library.

- **Images:** Replace the images by uploading your own and updating their URLs.
