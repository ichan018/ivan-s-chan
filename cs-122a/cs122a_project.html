          <p>I measured temperature and humidity with Arduino project that had breadboard, LEDs, and resistors.</p>
          <p> Every 1000 ticks (1 second), the machine does 2 tasks:</p>

          <ol>
          <li>Check the brightness of the surroundings</li>
          <li>Check the temperature and humidity of its surroundings.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The photoresistor checks the brightness of its surroundings and returns a number. The number is between 0 and 1024, where 0 is maximum brightness and 1024 is minimum brightness. </p>
          
          <pre>
            if number is less than 600: 
               1 LED light will turn on
               if number is less than 400:
                   a second LED will also turn on (2 LED lights will be on)
            
          </pre>

          <img src="led_1_light.png" alt="Breadboard connected to 2 blue LED lights. Left LED light is on. Right LED light is off. ">
          <p>1 LED is on. The LED brightness is less than 600.</p>

          <img src="led_2_lights.png" alt="Breadboard connected to 2 blue LED lights. Both left and right LEDs are on. ">
          <p>2 LEDs are on. The LED brightness is less than 400. The brightness is higher than the brightness in the previous picture.</p>
          
          <p>In the Arduino system, I used Serial.print() statements to make sure the functions worked as intended.The serial monitor printed out the brightness, temperature, and humidity. </p>
